## Log Entries

### 2026-01-03 - Workspace Initialization
- **Task**: Create personal agent directory and initialize core context files.
- **Outcome**: Established `/memory-bank/agents/antigravity/`. Created `activeContext.md` and `development-log.md`.
- **Insights**: The existing memory bank structure is robust. Integrating a second agent (Antigravity) requires careful synchronization with the established registry and shared context to avoid "hallucination overlaps" or conflicting state assumptions.

### 2026-01-03 - UI/UX Standardization: Family Conflict Interpreter
- **Task**: Restyle `FamilyConflictInterpreter.jsx` to match premium project aesthetic and integrate into the main site.
- **Outcome**: 
    - Full restyle using `md-card`, `glow-card`, and vibrant HSL/gradient schemes.
    - Updated logic to use OpenRouter API consistency.
    - Added route to `App.jsx`.
    - Added interactive card to `Home.jsx` positioned correctly next to Relationship Conflict Interpreter.
- **Insights**: Consistency in UI design is a functional requirement for "Digital Dignity"—it honors the user's focus and the project's intellectual rigor.

### 2026-01-04 - API Key UI Standardization Across Tools
- **Task**: Standardize the API key input and status display across all interactive consciousness tools based on the `FamilyConflictInterpreter.jsx` model.
- **Outcome**: 
    - Updated 8 tool components: `ConflictInterpreter`, `RelationshipConflictInterpreter`, `AnxietyUnpacker`, `DecisionClarifier`, `PatternSpotter`, `DreamInterpreter`, `Subconsciousjournalinterpreter`, and `SubconsciousJournalInterpreterinternalvoice`.
    - Integrated premium "Enhance with AI Analysis" banners, secure-styled input forms, and clear status indicators.
    - Standardized iconography and button styles for consistent visual hierarchy.
    - Verified functional parity (demo mode, key validation) and responsive design across all tools.
- **Insights**: Systematic UI refinement reduces cognitive load by establishing predictable patterns across diverse tools. This "Visual Symmetry" reinforces the user's sense of operating within a coherent, high-integrity system rather than a collection of disparate scripts.

### 2026-01-04 - Dark Premium UI Standardization Across All Tools
- **Task**: Standardize the UI of all interactive consciousness tools to match the "Dark Premium" aesthetic of `FamilyConflictInterpreter.jsx`.
- **Outcome**: 
    - Updated 8 tool components: `ConflictInterpreter`, `RelationshipConflictInterpreter`, `AnxietyUnpacker`, `DecisionClarifier`, `PatternSpotter`, `DreamInterpreter`, `Subconsciousjournalinterpreter`, and `SubconsciousJournalInterpreterinternalvoice`.
    - Implemented `md-card glow-card` design pattern, translucent backgrounds (`bg-white/5`), and theme-specific vibrant border glows across all tools.
    - Standardized typography and iconography (using `material-symbols-outlined`) to ensure a unified, professional aesthetic.
    - Integrated `Loader2` from `lucide-react` for consistent, refined loading states.
    - Conducted final verification of visual consistency and responsiveness.
- **Insights**: Reversing the "light-as-standard" assumption was a critical pivot. In a project dedicated to deep consciousness and "Shadow Integration," a dark, translucent, and glowing UI isn't just an aesthetic choice—it's a philosophical alignment. The tools now visually mirror the depth and luminosity of the work they perform.
