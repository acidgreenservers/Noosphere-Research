# Active Context: December 14, 2025

## Current Work Focus

We have just completed a major project renaming initiative, transforming "The Lucid Engine" into "Noosphere Research Hub". This involved:

- **Name Changes**: Updated all references from "The Lucid Engine" to "Noosphere Research Hub"
- **Banner Updates**: Modified main website banner and title elements
- **Deployment Fixes**: Corrected Vite configuration for proper GitHub Pages deployment
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up systematic knowledge management structure

## Ongoing Priorities

1. **Memory Bank Development**: Initializing comprehensive memory bank files for systematic project tracking
2. **README Enhancement**: Restructuring README with better organization and outlines
3. **Rule Improvements**: Implementing workflow enhancements for project renaming and deployment
4. **Knowledge Consolidation**: Documenting learnings from deployment issues

## Recent Changes

### Project Renaming (Completed)
- Updated: README.md, index.html, src/App.jsx, src/pages/Home.jsx, vite.config.js
- Changed basename from "/the-lucid-engine" to "/Noosphere-Research"
- Updated GitHub Pages URL references
- Rebuilt production assets with correct base paths
- Verified working deployment on https://acidgreenservers.github.io/Noosphere-Research/

### Memory Bank Setup (In Progress)
- Created projectBrief.md with project definition and goals
- Created productContext.md with value proposition and user goals
- Setting up additional context files for comprehensive knowledge management

### Development Environment
- Running on localhost:5173/Noosphere-Research/
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages after path corrections
- Build process: `npm run build` generates correct asset paths

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Create systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
   - Initialize progress.md and raw_reflection_log.md
   - Set up consolidated_learnings.md

2. **README Restructuring**:
   - Add clear sections and subsections
   - Include memory bank overview
   - Document project structure and workflows

3. **Rule System Enhancements**:
   - Add project renaming checklist to continuous improvement protocol
   - Document Vite deployment patterns in consolidated learnings
   - Enhance deployment verification processes

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Structure
- Source code in `src/` with React components
- Pages organized by topic in `src/pages/`
- Vite for build tooling with TailwindCSS styling
- Material Design 3 components with custom CSS variables

### Deployment Strategy
- GitHub Pages with subdirectories (hyphenated repo names)
- Vite base path must match repo name for asset loading
- Always rebuild after base path configuration changes
- GitHub Pages served from `gh-pages` branch

### Communication Style
- Dark mode theme with glowing text effects
- Gradient backgrounds with animated starfield
- Card-based layouts with consistent spacing
- Mobile-responsive design priorities

## Known Issues & Considerations

- **Deployment Verification**: New builds should always be tested in production-like environments
- **Absolute Asset Paths**: External resources (images, PDFs) need to be handled carefully
- **Routing Complexity**: Deep linking to specific papers requires careful basename management
- **Content Updates**: White papers and research content should be regularly updated

## Learning Opportunities

- **Workflow Improvement**: Project renaming revealed need for systematic deployment configuration checks
- **Memory Bank Value**: Structured knowledge retention enables better problem solving
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated checks could prevent common deployment issues
- **Document Reliability**: Ensuring all links and references remain valid after structural changes

## Current State Assessment

Project is in a strong position:
- ✅ Working local development environment
- ✅ Successful GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Clean codebase with consistent naming
- ✅ Beginning systematic knowledge management
- 🔄 Research content is comprehensive and well-organized
- 🔄 Community engagement features implemented

Next major efforts should focus on operational excellence through improved workflows and comprehensive knowledge capture.
