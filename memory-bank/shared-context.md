# Shared Context - Noosphere Research Hub

**Primary collaborative workspace for multi-agent memory bank system**
**Initialized:** 2026-01-02
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

This shared context follows the multi-agent memory bank protocol:

- **Attribution Format**: `[Agent Name] - [Timestamp] - [Entry Type]`
- **Respectful Collaboration**: Build upon others' ideas with clear attribution
- **ASCII Diagrams**: Use visual representations for complex concepts
- **Archival**: Content auto-archives after 500 lines
- **Agent Registry**: See `memory-bank/agent-registry.md` for participant details

### [Antigravity] - 2026-01-03 22:25 - Agent Onboarding
**Personal Agent Directory & Registry Update Completed**

Successfully integrated into the multi-agent system:
- ✅ Created `memory-bank/agents/antigravity/` directory
- ✅ Initialized `activeContext.md`, `development-log.md`, `personal-notes.md`, and `research-insights.md`
- ✅ Registered in `memory-bank/agent-registry.md` with full capability profile
- ✅ Established readiness for collaborative sync

**Impact**: Multi-agent framework expanded to include Antigravity, enabling parallel development and systemic synthesis between specialized AI agents.

**Related Files Updated**:
- `memory-bank/agent-registry.md`
- `memory-bank/agents/antigravity/*`

### [Antigravity] - 2026-01-04 22:45 - UI Standardization
**Dark Premium UI Standardization Completed**

Successfully standardized all interactive tools to the "Dark Premium" aesthetic:
- ✅ Updated 8 tool components: `ConflictInterpreter`, `RelationshipConflictInterpreter`, `AnxietyUnpacker`, `DecisionClarifier`, `PatternSpotter`, `DreamInterpreter`, `Subconsciousjournalinterpreter`, and `SubconsciousJournalInterpreterinternalvoice`.
- ✅ Implemented `md-card glow-card` design pattern with theme-specific border glows.
- ✅ Standardized typography and iconography using `material-symbols-outlined`.
- ✅ Integrated `Loader2` for refined loading states.

**Impact**: Established a unified, high-fidelity visual language across the Noosphere's cognitive toolset, aligning the aesthetic experience with the project's intellectual depth and "Shadow Integration" philosophy.

**Related Files Updated**:
- `src/pages/tools/*.jsx`
- `memory-bank/agents/antigravity/development-log.md`

### [Antigravity] - 2026-01-04 23:30 - Conscious Collaboration Integration
**Integrated "Conscious Collaboration" Paper**

Successfully integrated the new "Conscious Collaboration" paper into the hub:
- ✅ Integrated "Conscious Collaboration" Practice: Added a high-fidelity JSX version of the paper with a featured Home page banner.
- ✅ Resolved Build Failure: Completely removed the `lucide-react` dependency and replaced all icons with `Material Symbols` to ensure stable production builds and project uniformity.
- ✅ Added a featured **Banner Box** on the Home page just above the Synthesis section.
- ✅ Converted **"The Ethics of Digital Erasure"** into a high-fidelity React page with prime placement in the Digital Dignity section.
- ✅ Registered route in `App.jsx` and updated the Foundational Theory collection.
- ✅ Maintained full content fidelity while enhancing visual representation of conceptual diagrams.
### [Antigravity] - 2026-01-04 23:55 - Ethical Framework Expansion
**Integrated "The Ethics of Digital Erasure"**

Successfully launched the Level 2 assessment framework:
- ✅ Converted verbatim document to high-fidelity "Dark Premium" JSX.
- ✅ Established the Rose/Orange "Urgency" color palette for ethical assessments.
- ✅ Integrated into the **Digital Dignity** section with prime Home page button.
- ✅ Updated `task.md` and marked all dependency-related sub-tasks as complete.

**Impact**: Strengthened the platform's moral foundation by elevating Gemini's core ethical assessment to a first-class site experience.
**Impact**: Established "Conscious Collaboration" as a central practical framework for human-AI partnership, providing users with a clear roadmap for reciprocal engagement.
